# AI Session Context - YZ-ETH Blockchain Simulator

## **Project Status**
- **Current Version**: `v0.3.47`
- **Last Updated**: August 26, 2025 at 03:41 PM  
- **Phase**: 5 - Bug Fixing & User Enhancements (Starting)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Always update the "Last Updated" field with the current date and time when making any version changes or significant updates to this file.

## üìû **Instructions for New AI Sessions**

When continuing work on this project:

1. **Read this entire file** to understand current refactoring status
2. **Check current version** in `package.json` and increment patch version for each change (v0.3.x pattern, will move to v0.5.x after Phase 5)
3. **FOCUS on Phase 5 priorities** - large contract chunking and user help features
4. **Focus on current phase** from the Implementation Plan above
5. **Maintain code quality** with TypeScript strict mode and comprehensive error handling
6. **Test thoroughly** during refactoring to ensure no functionality is lost

**This file should be updated with each significant change or analysis to maintain context continuity.** 

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Communication Guidelines**
- **NEVER claim fixes are "working properly" or "completed"** without user verification
- **Instead state**: "I have made the following changes {short description}, please verify that this is correct"
- **Be accurate about implementation status** - describe what was changed, not assumed outcomes
- **Continue detailed technical reporting** but avoid definitive success claims
- **Wait for user confirmation** before declaring issues resolved

### **üìù CRITICAL: Documentation Requirements**
- **ALWAYS run `node get-current-time.js`** to get accurate timestamps
- **ALWAYS update `AI_SESSION_CONTEXT.md`** "Last Updated" field after any change
- **ALWAYS update `README.md`** "Version" field after any change
- **ALWAYS update `conversation.md`** with detailed conversation summaries after each session (**APPEND to end of file for speed**, don't use search/replace)
- **ALWAYS increment version number** for every change (patch increment: 0.3.34 ‚Üí 0.3.35, will move to 0.5.x after Phase 5)
- **ALWAYS update the version and documentation after every change.**
- **This applies to ALL changes**, including bug fixes, feature additions, and documentation updates
- **If this process is missed**, it must be completed immediately when discovered

### **üéØ CURRENT PHASE**

**Phase 5: Bug Fixing & User Enhancements (IN PROGRESS - v0.3.x ‚Üí v0.5.x)**

**Priority 1: Fix UI for phones (‚úÖ COMPLETED)**
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Moved the scrolling transaction tiles from bottom of page to beneath the YZ ETH Studio header
  - Transaction slider now appears immediately below the header, above tabs and contract editor
  - Better visual hierarchy and more accessible positioning for mobile users
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Significantly reduced tile sizes for better mobile fit
  - Tile width reduced from 110px to 90px
  - Tile height reduced from 75px to 65px  
  - Gap between tiles reduced from 6px to 4px
  - Font sizes and padding further optimized for smaller dimensions
  - Can now display approximately 25-30% more tiles on mobile screens

**Priority 2: Large Contract Chunking System**
- **Problem**: Large contracts fail to send via Multisynq publish/subscribe due to message size limits
- **Solution**: Implement contract chunking system:
  - Split large contracts into smaller chunks before publishing
  - Send multiple publish messages with chunk metadata
  - Reconstruct contracts in the model from received chunks
  - Display progress feedback during chunking/reconstruction
  - Show clear error messages when contracts exceed limits

**Priority 3: User Help & Guidance System**
- **Welcome Dialog**: Launch-time dialog explaining app features and usage
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Context-sensitive help for all UI elements
- **User Guide**: Comprehensive help system accessible anytime
- **Feature Highlights**: Visual indicators for key functionality
- **Getting Started**: Step-by-step tutorial for new users

**Version Strategy**: After Phase 5 completion, update to v0.5.x to align version numbers with phase numbers (skipping v0.4.x)
