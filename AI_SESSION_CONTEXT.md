## **Project Status**
- **Current Version**: `v0.3.27`
- **Last Updated**: August 16, 2025 at 05:45 PM  
- **Phase**: 4 - Multi-file Support & Optimization (In Progress) - ‚úÖ Architecture Cleanup Complete
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **OPERATIONAL** - All core features working with real-time synchronization

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Always update the "Last Updated" field with the current date and time when making any version changes or significant updates to this file.

## üìû **Instructions for New AI Sessions**

When continuing work on this project:

1. **Read this entire file** to understand current refactoring status
2. **Check current version** in `package.json` and increment patch version for each change (v0.1.x pattern)
3. **PRIORITIZE Model-View refactoring** - do not implement features until v0.1.3 is complete
4. **Focus on current phase** from the Implementation Plan above
5. **Maintain code quality** with TypeScript strict mode and comprehensive error handling
6. **Test thoroughly** during refactoring to ensure no functionality is lost

**This file should be updated with each significant change or analysis to maintain context continuity.** 

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Communication Guidelines**
- **NEVER claim fixes are "working properly" or "completed"** without user verification
- **Instead state**: "I have made the following changes {short description}, please verify that this is correct"
- **Be accurate about implementation status** - describe what was changed, not assumed outcomes
- **Continue detailed technical reporting** but avoid definitive success claims
- **Wait for user confirmation** before declaring issues resolved

### **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Common User Requests & Context**
- **"Add new features"** ‚Üí ‚ùå STOP: Explain that features must wait until Model-View refactoring is complete (v0.1.3)
- **"Continue blockchain analysis work"** ‚Üí ‚ùå REDIRECT: Focus on refactoring first, then analytics can be properly implemented
- **"Fix deployment issues"** ‚Üí ‚úÖ OK: Address any deployment issues that affect refactoring work
- **"Improve performance"** ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Only performance improvements that support refactoring goals

### **üéØ Current Refactoring Status**
- **v0.1.0**: Model infrastructure creation (IN PROGRESS)
- **Next**: Core state migration (v0.1.1)
- **Goal**: Complete Model-View separation by v0.1.3
- **Then**: All planned features can be implemented cleanly on the new architecture

### **üìù CRITICAL: Documentation Requirements**
- **ALWAYS run `node get-current-time.js`** to get accurate timestamps
- **ALWAYS update `AI_SESSION_CONTEXT.md`** "Last Updated" field after any change
- **ALWAYS update `README.md`** "Version" field after any change
- **ALWAYS update `conversation.md`** with detailed conversation summaries after each session (**APPEND to end of file for speed**, don't use search/replace)
- **ALWAYS increment version number** for every change (patch increment: 0.1.45 ‚Üí 0.1.46)
- **ALWAYS update the version and documentation after every change.**
- **This applies to ALL changes**, including bug fixes, feature additions, and documentation updates
- **If this process is missed**, it must be completed immediately when discovered

1. **Phase 1: Model Infrastructure (v0.1.0)** - *CURRENT TASK*
   - Create `src/model/BlockchainModel.ts` with observer pattern
   - Define centralized state interfaces and types
   - Implement singleton pattern for model access

   - Centralize contract registry and deployment tracking

3. **Phase 3: Component Refactoring (v0.1.2)**
   - Replace all `useState` with model subscriptions in components
   - Remove all `setInterval` polling in favor of observer notifications
   - Update components to pure presentation logic

4. **Phase 4: UI State Centralization (v0.1.3)**
   - Move dialog states, editor code, active section into model
   - Eliminate redundant state across components
   - Complete separation of View and Model layers

### **‚ö†Ô∏è POST-REFACTORING Technical Debt** *(Address after v0.1.3)*
